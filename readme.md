Source Sans System Font Replacement for Yosemite
==============================

If you're not crazy about using Helvetica for your UI, this is an easy way to change it to something more suitable. After looking for a bit for alternatives, I found Source Sans to be a very good alternative, closer to Lucida Grande, and with a wide range of weights. 

The idea comes from Jens Jens Kutilek's [Fira Sans Replacement](https://github.com/jenskutilek/FiraSystemFontReplacement) and generated with Thai Pangsakulyanont's [Yosemite System Font Patcher](https://github.com/dtinth/YosemiteSystemFontPatcher).

### Warning: This package has not been extensively tested. It works in my system without problems, but use at your own risk.

# How it works
This does not hack or patch your OS in any way. It is a completely non-destructive way to replace the systemfont. It works by modifying the Source Sans font files to set their names to what Yosemite expects Helvetica to be. By placing them in your /library/fonts folder, they will be loaded before the actual Helvetica fonts. The original fonts are not modified or replaced. 

# Known Issues
- User name is misaligned in the menubar
- Descenders get cut off in spotlight

# How to install
